> Data structures and methods for working with PSDs

## Background / Initial Motivation

I had an `imagemagick` script for a couple of years for exporting specific layers from PSDs but that broken down when I upgraded `imagemagick`.

After a bit of Googling I couldn't land on a solution for my problem so I made this crate.

If there's anything missing that you need please feel very free to open an issue!

## Usage

```rust
```
