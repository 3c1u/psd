> Data structures and methods for working with PSDs

## Background / Initial Motivation

I had an `imagemagick` script for a couple of years for exporting specific layers from PSDs but that broken down when I upgraded `imagemagick`.

After a bit of Googling I couldn't land on a solution for my problem so I made this crate.

If anything is missing from the spec it's because I don't need it for my use case.

That being said, I'm more than happy to add whatever you need, just open an issue!

## Usage

```rust
```
